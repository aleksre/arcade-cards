**Privacy Policy**

Last updated: January 25, 2015

This privacy policy applies to the Arcade Card Reader app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Rem Tech AS (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

**What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?**

While using the Application, Usage Data may be collected automatically. Usage Data may include information such as your Device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), device identifiers, operating system, network type, NFC tag information, and other diagnostic data. Registration/Sign-up is not required to use the Application.

The data collected is used to provide and maintain the service and functionality of the Application. Specifically, to be able to display the Amusement IC access codes.

**Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?**

This Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.

**Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?**

Reading data from an Amusement IC card relies on a third party service to fetch the Amusement IC Access Code, this third party service will thus have access to the card identifier and any related codes.

**What are my opt-out rights?**

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by disabling network access on your device (such as enabling Flight Mode). The Application is still usable in this mode, only the Access Code (for Amusement IC cards) will not be displayed.

**Changes**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy.
