**Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy applies to the Arcade Card Reader app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Rem Tech AS (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

**What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?**

The Application does not collect any personally identifiable information during use or installation. Registration is not required to use the Application. If an Amusement IC cards is read into the Application, an external third party lookup service is used to fetch the Access Code. The Application does not collect any other data whatsoever.

**Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?**

This Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.

**Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?**

Since the Application relies on a third party service to fetch the Amusement IC Access Code, this third party service will have access to the card identifier and all related codes.

**What are my opt-out rights?**

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by disabling network access on your device (such as enabling Flight Mode). The Application is still usable in this mode, only the Access Code (for Amusement IC cards) will not be displayed.

The Application is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider (aleksander.rem@outlook.com) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).
